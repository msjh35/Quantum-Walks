# Quantum-Walks

Example code for one dimensional and two dimensional quantum walks. The following two-dimensional quantum walks are included:
- walk on a cylinder (reflective and periodic boundary condition)
- walk on torus (periodic boundary conditions)
- walk on klein bottle (periodic and twisted boundary condition)

The code is based on: https://quantumai.google/cirq/experiments/quantum_walks, which discusses one-dimensional quantum walks on a line.
