# Quantum-Walks

Example code for one dimensional and two dimensional quantum walks. The following two-dimensional quantum walks are included:
- walk on a cylinder (reflective and periodic boundary condition)
- walk on a torus (2 periodic boundary conditions)
- walk on a klein bottle (periodic and twisted boundary condition)
- walk on a rectangle (2 reflective boundary conditions)

The code is based on: https://quantumai.google/cirq/experiments/quantum_walks, which discusses one-dimensional quantum walks on a line.
